# **Concepts**

> ### **Healing** 

> 1. Healing can be found in the world for small heals 25%
> 2. Full Heal and Safe point are cryogenic tubes
>    - It is not the tube that heals but the passage of time.
>    - E.g. Full heal is 6 day night cycles "Recovery" happening in 3 seconds as visuals speed up day and night cycle pass and that recovers health. 

> ### **Locations**

> #### buildings
> 1. Entry to buildings does not have load screen, it fades what would not be visible through the doorway to black and does a Tardis - the inside is bigger than the outside.
